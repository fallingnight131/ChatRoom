# Reproducible M0 Verification

The M0 verifier provides one entry point for source-inventory drift, the web
production build, and optional Qt release builds.

## Inventory

Requires Python 3.9 or newer:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py
```

This compares `Common/Protocol.h`, `ChatServer.cpp`, and
`DatabaseManager.cpp` against `docs/baselines/v1-inventory.json`.

When an intentional protocol/schema/dispatch change is reviewed, regenerate the
baseline and include it in the same commit:

```bash
python3 tools/m0_inventory.py --write
python3 tools/m0_inventory.py --check
```

Never regenerate merely to hide unexpected drift.

## Web

Requires a supported Node.js release and npm:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --web
```

The command runs `npm ci`, the Node regression tests, and `npm run build`. To
reuse already installed dependencies during local iteration:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --web --skip-npm-ci
```

CI runs inventory and web verification on every push and pull request through
`.github/workflows/m0-baseline.yml`.

Native product Release builds run through
`.github/workflows/m0-product-builds.yml`. The pinned and distro toolchains are
documented in `docs/architecture/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`.

## Server Password Hashing Dependency

All server and database test targets require libsodium:

- macOS/Homebrew: `brew install libsodium`;
- Ubuntu 24.04: `sudo apt install libsodium-dev pkg-config`;
- Windows/MSVC: run `vcpkg install --triplet x64-windows` from the repository,
  then set `SODIUM_ROOT` to `vcpkg_installed/x64-windows` before running qmake.

The authentication migration regression is:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --password-hash
```

It covers new Argon2id registration, correct/incorrect verification, successful
legacy SHA-256 upgrade, wrong-password non-mutation, password change, and
parameter-driven rehash.

## SQLite Schema Regression

Requires Qt Core, Qt SQL, the SQLite Qt driver, libsodium, qmake, and a platform
compiler:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --db-schema
```

The test creates an isolated temporary database, verifies every required V1
table and migrated column after the first initialization, runs
`PRAGMA integrity_check`, initializes again to simulate a restart, and requires
both schema snapshots to be identical.

This regression runs as its own Ubuntu 24.04 CI job. It intentionally avoids Qt
GUI dependencies so database validation is independent of desktop packaging and
graphics toolchains.

## V1 TCP Smoke Test

Requires Qt Core, Network, SQL, WebSockets, the SQLite driver, qmake, and a
platform compiler:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --v1-smoke
```

The command builds `Tests/HeadlessServer.pro` from the production server sources
with only server-side image thumbnail generation disabled. It then launches the
server on an isolated local three-port range with a temporary database and file
directory.

The smoke client verifies registration, login, room creation/join, authenticated
sender identity, message fan-out, history persistence, file notification
metadata, disconnect/reconnect, persistent membership, post-reconnect delivery,
and recall. It does not use production ports, credentials, databases, or COS.

CI runs the same smoke test on Ubuntu 24.04 after installing Qt Base, Qt SQLite,
Qt WebSockets, and libsodium development packages.

## V1 Performance Baseline

The performance scenario uses the same production server sources as the TCP
smoke test. It creates authenticated clients on loopback, joins them to one
room, sends warm-up messages, and then records message persistence/fan-out:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --performance
```

The default JSON result is written to
`build/m0/<platform>/v1-performance.json`. To create a reviewed, stored baseline:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --performance \
  --performance-clients 8 \
  --performance-warmup 20 \
  --performance-messages 100 \
  --performance-output docs/baselines/M0_PERFORMANCE_YYYY-MM-DD.json
```

The result records the exact scenario and environment, send-to-own-echo latency,
SQLite `saveMessage` latency, accepted-message and fan-out throughput, sampled
server CPU/RSS, and available artifact sizes. It is a regression reference, not
a production capacity promise: loopback networking, sequential acknowledgements,
and a single process intentionally make the run small and repeatable.

CI executes a shorter version to ensure the harness remains operational. It
does not enforce a latency threshold on shared hosted runners.

## Qt Server and Desktop Client

Requires Qt with Core, GUI, Widgets, Network, SQL, WebSockets, and Multimedia,
plus libsodium, qmake, and the platform compiler:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --qt
```

Set `QMAKE` when several Qt installations exist:

```bash
QMAKE=/path/to/qmake6 python3 tools/verify_m0.py --qt
```

Build products are written below ignored `build/m0/<platform>/` directories.

Use a Qt build that officially supports the selected operating-system SDK. Do
not patch a global Qt installation or silently remove framework dependencies to
make a local build appear successful.

## Full Local Verification

```bash
python3 tools/verify_m0.py --all
```

The full command includes inventory, web, SQLite schema, V1 smoke, and both Qt
product targets. It is expected to fail when a required compiler, Qt module, or
supported platform SDK is unavailable. Report that environment limitation and
retain the successful component results.

## Windows Notes

- Run from a Qt/Visual Studio or Qt/MinGW developer environment.
- The verifier selects `nmake` for an MSVC qmake spec and
  `mingw32-make`/`make` otherwise.
- Native CI uses MSVC 2022 and pinned Qt 6.11.1, then runs `windeployqt` to
  assemble a short-lived unsigned verification artifact.
- A signed installer, upgrade/uninstall behavior, and automatic updates are
  separate M4 concerns.

## macOS Notes

- Install Xcode command-line tools and a Qt build compatible with the active SDK.
- Native CI uses pinned Qt 6.11.1 and runs `macdeployqt` to assemble a
  short-lived unsigned verification artifact.
- M0 does not perform code signing, notarization, stapling, or DMG creation;
  those are M4 release gates.
